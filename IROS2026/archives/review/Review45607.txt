Comments to the author
======================

Summary:
The paper addresses the issue of safe robot reinforcement
learning under manifold constraints and perception
uncertainty. The authors propose a manifold-filtering
framework that integrates safe reachable space
construction, reward calibration through manifold
constraints, and data-driven IMU localization to manage
sensor errors.

Strengths:
The results presented by the authors appear promising. They
demonstrate that their proposed method achieves lower costs
compared to baseline methods across several simulated
tasks.

Weaknesses:
The paper has several significant shortcomings:
1. The introduction does not clearly convey the exact
problem the authors aim to address or explicitly state the
contributions. For instance, the authors mention that prior
methods focused on post-training policy safety, limiting
their real-world deployment, but fail to provide concrete
examples or deeper insights into why this is problematic.
Additionally, the authors highlight previous methods'
reliance on environment information as a limitation but
then propose an approach that constructs environment-aware
safe reachable space", that similarly depends on
environmental data. It remains unclear how their method
overcomes the same limitation.

2. Although simulation results show promise, the current
evaluation lacks depth and diversity. The experiments are
limited to a few simulated tasks, and without real-world
validation, the practical relevance and robustness of the
method remain unconvincing.

3. The paper suffers from poor writing quality and
organizational issues. The narrative is difficult to
follow, and there are inconsistencies in formatting at the
end of the manuscript.
