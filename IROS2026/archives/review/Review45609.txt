Comments to the author
======================

This paper focuses on safe reinforcement learning under
localization uncertainty using manifold constraints.

- The main contribution of the paper is claimed to be
manifold-based safety filtering, however, it is not clear
how this filter works, and it is not explained well in the
paper either.  According to the diagram in Fig. 1, the
safety filter takes a_uncert as an input and outputs
a_safe, but this process is not explained.

- The definition of safety condition c(s_t) is not very
clear (First equation in Section II). The right-hand side
depends on i, but the left-hand side does not. 

- If the system is nonlinear, why is the Kalman filter used
instead of the ones that are suitable for nonlinear
dynamics (e.g., UKF, EKF, particle filter)

- Why does Eq. 3 create a safe velocity? 

- None of the baseline papers are cited properly.

- Experiments are not explained in detail. How many times
were the algorithms run? Does Table 1 list average results,
or are they coming from a single run?

- Since ROS experiments are also done in simulations, they
do not add much value in terms of representing real sensor
noise. The paper mentions safety in the presence of a
sim-to-real gap, but there are no real experiments.

- The paper does not use the correct format, and it has
unnecessary blank spaces on pages 6 and 7.

- The paper needs a major rewrite. Notations are mostly
either unclear or not properly defined. Some examples are
as follows:
- s_t is not defined
- \alpha in Eq. 3 is not defined
- dist is not defined.
- The dimensionality of \mu (G) is not defined
- Task 1 collision condition c = (D_hazard -
D_hazard)*\gamma would be always equal to zero.
